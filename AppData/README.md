# App-level settings files

Settings in this directory have different directories depending on what OS it's being set up under.

For example:

VS Code has a `settings.json` that can be installed in one of several places:

* **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`
* **Mac:** `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`
* **Linux:** `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
